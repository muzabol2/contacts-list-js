## General info
Application allows you to:
* The list of contacts is **sorted** alphabetically by **last_name**
* The page displays a list of contacts in the following format: **{avatar} | {first_name last_name} | {checkbox}** 
* When a user **clicks** on a contact (list item) the checkbox **toggles** on/off and it **console.log IDs** of all selected contacts
* **Text input** at the top of the list allows you to **filter** the contacts by **first_name** and **last_name**. Searching doesn't cause contacts to become unchecked.
